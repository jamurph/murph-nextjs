## Entropy

Decay into disorder is the natural state of things.

This is true for particles in the universe, but it is also true of our time.

Left alone, any schedules, habits, and policies we have that determine how we spend our time will gradually wither away.

If we want to keep them or encourage even better ones, we have to feed energy into the system.

In this case of our time, we need motivational energy.

## What Disorder?

The difficulty with imposing order on anything is knowing where the disorder is, to begin with.

We can't focus on something we know nothing of.

If we don't know where the disorder in our time is, the best we can do is expend tons of energy on the whole system.

This is unsustainable.

If we want to improve our schedules and habits, we need to find some way to measure them so that we can apply what little motivational energy we have where it is needed most.

## Measuring Can Suck.
If you've ever used a time tracking app, it can be a bit depressing.

Sometimes the act of measuring something can take energy.

When we see that we've spent too much time on things that don't make a difference towards our larger goals, it can have the opposite effect of what it is meant to.

It's demoralizing.

## Measure The Right Stuff

Get out of the minutiae. You don't need to track _literally everything_.

You don't need to keep track of every second you spend on your goals.

You don't even need to track your goals.

I'd like to propose an alternative.

Track your effort working towards principles.

## Principles

Goals are fleeting. By the time you get any good data on them, they are liable to change.

I have chosen to track my effort towards these principles every day:

* **Wisdom** - Have I done something to make myself wiser today?
* **Autonomy** - Have I worked towards my freedom? e.g. Financial.
* **Discipline** - Did I get up when my alarm went off? Did I take care of basic daily chores?
* **Fitness** - Did I work out? Did I eat healthily?
* **Warmth** - Did I contribute something positive to someone else's day?

My wife and I actually print out this sheet at the start of every month:

I know some apps can track this sort of thing, but I like the tangibility of filling in the boxes by hand.

We keep it hanging on the fridge. Every time we go for food or water, we are reminded of what we need to do.

## Streaks

One of the great things about this method is that it creates visual streaks.

Yes, the principles in and of themselves are worth pursuing, but every marked box helps give the motivation to fill in the next day's.

It helps you keep moving. When you see this every few hours - when you see the streak of effort over the last few days - it makes you want to maintain the streak.

Every "little win" you get contributes to the next one.

It's a great way of tracking your effort that also helps create a positive feedback loop to encourage future effort.
