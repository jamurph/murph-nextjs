## Embark.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Willingness to move - to take risks. All choice is risk-laden. Inaction is a choice, too.
choosing to think about possible actions is a good thing, but can't be in endless preparation - aka analysis paralysis. Cannot plan for every contingency. Cannot ensure logical certitude of the first-order objects of the expedition - need to set your mind onto higher-order, more transcendant goals.


## Explore.
If your goal is to map out the territory - to learn and grow - then the only wrong turns are towards what is already known. You may have expectations or hopes about where your current heading might take you, but you need to able to be wrong and to keep choosing alternative headings. 
Error is the sole condition of learning - Stanislas Dehaene


## Empower
Why embark? Why explore? To find (or perhaps create) a new world more conducive to life and the pursuit of meaning.
